Hello, 

As you know, Upwork is a global freelancing platform where businesses and independent professionals connect and collaborate remotely.
Many companies find remote engineers for their upcoming projects then make the contract via upwork and go ahead with the contract.
I have also worked as a freelancer for several years on Upwork.
I have rich experience in working on Upwork as a full stack developer.
But I have problem with my work.
Recently I moved to another location so I can't work with my upwork account because upwork ban if I connect upwork on different location or vpn.
So if you provide a free laptop or VMware(because I don't want to access your privacy data), I can continue my work with my upwork account.
Can you help me with that?
Then I'll payout 5% of my earning to you.

We can discuss via telegram in more.
My id is https://t.me/notchnotch
Looking forward to your reply.
Thank you.
